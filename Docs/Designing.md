This document is going to be a record of my progress in this Project

First thing I wanted to implement is the ALU, I found a great resource on GameBoy Arcectecture.
https://gbdev.io/pandocs/
https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.8.0/gbz80.7#SUB_A,r8
Using the pandocs I was able to make a list of the core instructions the ALU would need to complete. 
I Have been creating every instruction either through dataflow or structural.
